# hotel
project individual 
Two roles: admin and user. Admin can add new hotels and add opportunities to the hotels 
(in which time period, how many rooms are available, and how much does it cost?). 
Admin can attach photos about the hotel rooms and add information about the possible services 
(e.g.: pool, own restaurant, closest spa x km far from the hotel, etc.). Users can register 
to the website and after the registration they can book hotel rooms. Users can only book a 
room at a given hotel or cancel the reservation. Admin can list all the bookings, users can list 
only their own bookings.
